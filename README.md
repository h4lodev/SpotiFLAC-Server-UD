* **Built-in Library Viewer:** View your downloaded audio files directly from the web interface without needing to SSH into your server.
* **Customizable Settings:** Choose your preferred source service (Tidal, Qobuz, Deezer, Amazon) and output folder structure (e.g., Artist/Album layout) via a sleek dropdown menu.
* **Media Server Friendly:** Perfect for feeding high-fidelity FLAC files directly into your self-hosted music library.
* **Runtipi Optimized:** Includes necessary configurations to run effortlessly as a Custom App behind Runtipi's reverse proxy.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option A: Deployment via Runtipi (Recommended)

If you are using [Runtipi](https://runtipi.io/) to manage your home server, follow these steps to integrate the app smoothly:

1. **Clone the repository to your server:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ACRZeuss/spotiflac-server.git
   cd spotiflac-server
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image locally:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t spotiflac-server:latest .
    ```

    Add as a Custom App in Runtipi:

    1. Open your Runtipi Dashboard -> App Store -> Add Custom App.
    2. Name it spotiflac.
    3. Paste the following YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    x-runtipi:
      schema_version: 2

    services:
      spotiflac:
      build: .
      image: spotiflac-server:latest
      container_name: spotiflac-server
      restart: unless-stopped
      x-runtipi:
        internal_port: 5000
        is_main: true
      volumes:
        # Runtipi'nin global medya klasörüne bağlıyoruz
        - ${MEDIA_DIR}/Music:/downloads
        - ${MEDIA_DIR}/Music:/app/downloads 
      environment:
        - PUID=1000
        - PGID=1000
        - TZ=Europe/Istanbul
    ```

    Click Install. You can now access SpotiFLAC Server directly from your Runtipi dashboard!

### Option B: Standalone Docker Compose

If you are not using Runtipi, you can run it using standard Docker Compose:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ACRZeuss/spotiflac-server.git
    cd spotiflac-server
    ```

2. **Edit docker-compose.yml (Optional):**

   Change the volume path from `/opt/runtipi/media/music` to your preferred local music directory.

   Build and start the container:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

   Access the web interface at `http://<your-server-ip>:5000`.

### ⚙️ Usage

1. Open the web interface.

2. Select your preferred language (EN/TR) from the top right corner.

3. Expand the Download Settings panel to select your source (Tidal, Qobuz, etc.) and folder layout.

4. Paste a Spotify track, album, or playlist URL into the input field.

5. Click Download.

6. The UI will display the live progress. Once completed, the files will automatically appear in the Library section below and sync with your media server.
